**Code**: [Bank Marketing Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Chama1026/bank_marketing_campaign_analysis/blob/main/Bank%20Marketing%20Analysis.ipynb)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using Python to analyze the "Bank Marketing" database from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which comprises data collected from phone marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The primary objective of these campaigns is to encourage customers to subscribe to term deposits offered by the bank.

The primary goals of the project are to discover actionable insights on the key factors influencing the success of the phone marketing campaign and to develop a predictive model that enables the sales team to prioritize potential customers effectively.

## Python Library 
- **pandas**: For loading the dataset, data cleaning, data transformation, and data analysis.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **sklearn**: For building a logistic regression model.
- **imblearn**: For building a Random Forest Classifier model.
